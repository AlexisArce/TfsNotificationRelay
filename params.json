There are [more settings and formats][1] in there that should be somewhat self-explanatory.\r\nInstall the Tfs2Slack plugin by dropping `DevCore.Tfs2Slack.dll`, `DevCore.Tfs2Slack.dll.config` and `Newtonsoft.Json.dll` in *C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Team Foundation Server 12.0\\Application Tier\\Web Services\\bin\\Plugins* on the server.\r\n\r\n[0]: https://github.com/kria/Tfs2Slack/releases\r\n[1]: https://github.com/kria/Tfs2Slack/blob/master/Tfs2Slack/app.config\r\n\r\n## TFS 2013 version support\r\n\r\nBecause of a breaking API change in TFS 2013 Update 2, the plugin as is only works for TFS 2013 update 2 and 3 (and possibly later).\r\nI will publish a branch with support for previous TFS 2013 versions at a later date.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 2014 Kristian Adrup\r\n\r\nTfs2Slack is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
